# Post-It
Post It is a mobile application developed using React Native that enables users to monetize their personal tasks. The app allows users to post tasks along with a price, and other users can accept and complete those tasks. Once a task is accepted, a messaging system is created between the two users, facilitating communication.

Features
User Registration: Users can create an account or log in using their existing credentials.
Task Posting: Users can post tasks they need assistance with, including a description and the desired price for completing the task.
Task Acceptance: Other users can browse and accept available tasks.
Messaging System: Once a task is accepted, a messaging system is initiated between the task poster and the task acceptor, allowing them to communicate and coordinate the task.
